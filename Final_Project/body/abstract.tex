This project focuses on the review of the Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion (CWMR) strategy\cite{OnlinePortfolio} proposed by Li \emph{et al.} for online portfolio selection. The CWMR strategy models the portfolio vector as a Gaussian distribution and sequentially updates the distribution (mean and covariance) according to the mean reversion trading idea. We reproduced a cumulative gain of around 10$^{18}$\% after 5600 trading days as was claimed in the paper, and found this astronomical gain was also achievable in different time periods and various stock markets. Finally, we propose a revised method, named ``A-Stock-A-Day Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion" (ASAD-CWMR), which maintains the power of original approach and greatly reduces the transaction cost, and is thus more feasible for personal investments.
