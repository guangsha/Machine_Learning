\section{Conclusion}
In this project we reviewed and implemented the Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion (CWMR) strategy proposed by Li \emph{et al.} for online portfolio selection. We successfully reproduced a cumulative gain of around 10$^{18}$\% after 5600 trading days as was claimed in the paper, and found this astronomical gain was also achievable in different time periods and various stock markets. We also propose a revised method, named ``A-Stock-A-Day Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion" (ASAD-CWMR), which maintains the power of original approach and greatly reduces the transaction cost, and is thus more feasible for personal investments.

Guangsha Shi extracted historical data, designed and backtested the revised ASAD-CWMR algorithm, and evaluated the results. Sihui Han implemented, backtested, and discussed the CWMR algorithm. Han Lin implemented and backtested the Anticor algorithm. Dongyao Chen did an extensive literature review, assessed and discussed the algorithms for comparison.
